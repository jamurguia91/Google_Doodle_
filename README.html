<p>My Google Doodle is a tribute to one of my favorite childhood video games. Super Mario Bros 3 for the Snes or Nes, either console has ports for it. Although not apparent at first glance that what I have displayed on screen says Google. That was the intention. I wanted no lettering and to have the elements or icons resemble the lettering and wanted the viewer to piece it together. </p>
